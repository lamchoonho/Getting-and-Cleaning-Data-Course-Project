## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is about the submission of project for Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate to ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set for analysis in subsequent step. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here are the data for the project:

## Instruction

R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Documents
CodeBook.md (explain the variables and data) and output of result (cleanData.txt) are attached.

# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature info
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which
   reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those
   columns with the dataset
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Converts the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
